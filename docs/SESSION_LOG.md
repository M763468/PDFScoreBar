# Session Log (Measure Numbering Track)

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-04
**Context**: This log tracks the design and implementation of the "Measure Numbering" system (Plan A) in the `feature/measure_numbering` branch.

---

## 2026-01-04 Basic Numbering Logic Implementation

**Goal**: Implement the core linear numbering logic (`MeasureNumberer`).

### Actions Taken
- Implemented `MeasureNumberer` in `src/measure_numbering/numbering.py`.
    - Logic: Iterates systems, deduplicates barlines, creates measures based on intervals, assigns sequential numbers.
- Verified with unit tests (`test_numbering.py`).
- Fix: Made `Barline` and `BBox` types hashable (`unsafe_hash=True`) to support deduplication via `set()`.

### Results
- The core numbering engine is operational. It correctly threads measure numbers across systems and pages.
- Tested with synthesized simple systems.

## 2026-01-04 System Inference Logic (Simplification)

**Goal**: Implement logic to group staves into systems (`SystemBuilder`).

### Actions Taken
- Initially attempted to implement complex geometric heuristics (gap clustering).
- **Corrected Course**: Upon review, heuristics were deemed unreliable.
- Simplified `SystemBuilder` (`src/measure_numbering/builder.py`) to:
    1. Prefer explicit `system_index` if available.
    2. Fallback: Treat the page as a single system.
- Adjusted tests (`test_builder.py`) to reflect this simplified safe-default scope.

## 2026-01-04 Real Data Verification (Pipeline Prototype)

**Goal**: Validate the `SystemBuilder` and `MeasureNumberer` using real detection outputs from the "Best Baseline" snapshot.

### Methodology
Constructed a verification pipeline script (`tools/verify_measure_numbering_pipeline.py`) using:
1.  **Barline Input**: `logs/gt_rebuild_hybrid_eval/20260102T134300_best_repro_fullparams/per_page/page_10/end_recovered.json` (Final "End Recovered" barlines).
2.  **Staff Input**: `logs/homr_eval/20251229T_gt_rebuild_eval/page_10/page_10_debug_3_staff.png` (Homr Staff Mask).
3.  **Process**:
    *   **Staff Extraction**: Loaded binary mask, applied vertical dilation (kernel 1x20) to merge lines into bands, and extracted connected components.
    *   **Scaling Fix**: Discovered that `homr` masks are downscaled (1660x2214) relative to the original/barline coordinate space (2700x3600). Implemented upscaling logic for staff bands.
    *   **System Inference**: Simulating a "Part" score (1 staff = 1 system) by assigning unique system indices to each extracted staff.
    *   **Numbering**: Executed `MeasureNumberer` across the inferred systems.

### Results
-   **Staff Extraction**: Successfully identified 13 staff bands matching the visual structure of Page 10.
-   **Barline Assignment**: Barlines were correctly assigned to their respective staves after coordinate scaling.
-   **Numbering**: Successfully generated sequential measure numbers across systems.

## 2026-01-04 Logic Refinement: Deduplication and Implicit Start Completion

**Goal**: Resolve overlapping numbers and missing first measures observed in real data visualization.

### Actions Taken
1.  **Deduplication**:
    *   Added `_deduplicate_barlines` to `MeasureNumberer` with a 15px threshold.
    *   Reason: Detector outputs multiple candidates for the same visual barline, causing redundant "micro-measures".
2.  **Implicit Start Detection**:
    *   Added logic to `MeasureNumberer.number_system` to check the gap between system start and the first detected barline.
    *   Threshold: 50px. If exceeded, a "Ghost Barline" is inserted at the staff's left edge to capture the first measure.
3.  **Robust Assignment**:
    *   Relaxed `SystemBuilder` overlap threshold from 50% to 20% (or 10px minimum).
    *   Reason: Ensure short barline segments (typical in noisy detections) are correctly assigned to staves.
4.  **Visualization Update**:
    *   Numbers are now **centered** within measures.
    *   Ghost barlines are visualized in **magenta**.
    *   Staves are rendered with transparent blue fill for better context.

### Results
-   Verified on Page 10 with the full detector output (293 barlines).
-   Numbers are cleanly centered and duplicates are removed.
-   First measures (starting from the left margin) are now correctly captured.

**Conclusion**: The logic for deduplication and implicit start completion is approved for production use. The pipeline reliably handles noisy detector output and ensures logical measure continuity.

**Artifacts**:
- `tools/visualize_measure_numbering.py`: Updated visualization script.
- `logs/gt_rebuild_hybrid_eval/20260102T134300_best_repro_fullparams/per_page/page_10/measure_numbering_overlay_final.png`: Final verification image.
